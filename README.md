# 01 PROJECT OPERATION

This project was a test to see how we would react to refactoring. We as a class went into an already made html and css file and had to correct or change some code to make it meet accessibility standards. The first thing that I did was go in and find lines that I could input semantic. I then made sure that everything went in a logical structure regardless of styling and positioning. I then made sure that all images had an "alt" attribute so that if they didn't load the user could understand what was supposed to be there. After that I made sure that my headings fell in sequential order. For example, "h1" to "h2" and so on. Lastly I added a concise title to let the user know what the webpage is about. 

## PROJECT USES

This projects use was to get us ready for correcting and adjusting already made code. It allowed us to get used to understanding the basic HTML structure and how it will flow within a browser. When it came to the CSS it forced us to understand how the appearance was being adjusted based on classes and other tags. 

## GETTING STARTED

When I first looked at the README for this assignment I was confused because I didn't understand what I was supposed to do. The best advise that I can give when starting this project is to ask questions. Questions will eventually be your best friend because they will get you to an answer that can help you understand the basis of what you are trying to accomplish. 

## GETTING HELP

One of the first places to get help will be in class. Ask your instructor and TA's any questions that you have and they will answer them to the best of there abilities. Secondly, look online. Google will be your best friend when it comes to coding and developing because anything that you question, someone else has probably had the same thought. Lastly, just try it! It doesn't hurt to be wrong as long as you are trying!
